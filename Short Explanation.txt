This code creates a webpage where users can select the breed of their choice from a dropdown and a random picture of that breed is generated. An AJAX request is made for the list of breeds and for filling the dropdown when the page is loaded. Upon clicking the "Generate Dog" button after having selected a breed, another AJAX request retrieves a random image of the chosen breed, which is then displayed in the image container. Hover and active states on the button add interactive details to this design, which ensures that a layout clears up without any difficulties.
